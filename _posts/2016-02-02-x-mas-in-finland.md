  10 days in Finland meeting friends and family. Helsinki was beautiful and
  gloomy. Luckily for the last 2 days we actually got to experience a bit of
  winter (which I have dearly missed) when a few centimeters of snow and a
  brutally icy wind hit Helsinki. Goruck was packed to the extremes, when also
  the gifts that I got needed to be packed in.  Observations on clothing led to
  me adding a pair of 260 g/m leggings to my shopping list and buying a Särmä
  merino hoodie for my travels. Now I should be warm in any given weather.

# x-mas in Finland

10 days in Finland meeting friends and family. Helsinki was beautiful and gloomy. Luckily for the last 2 days we actually got to experience a bit of winter (which I have dearly missed) when a few centimeters of snow and a brutally icy wind hit Helsinki.  
Goruck was packed to the extremes, when also the gifts that I got needed to be packed in.   
Observations on clothing led to me adding a pair of 260 g/m leggings to my shopping list and buying a Särmä merino hoodie for my travels. Now I should be warm in any given weather.

As a part of the trip we drove up to Central Finland. The ice cover for the lake was just forming up and we used that chance to go for a small rowing trip.
